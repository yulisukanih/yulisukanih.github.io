They come with a small monthly rent amount and no need to worry about maintenance or repairs.</p><p>One-and two-bedroom apartments offer more space than studios, but they also require a higher monthly rent amount.</p><h2 id=luxurious-loft-apartment-in-stockholm-with-scandinavian-design>Luxurious Loft Apartment In Stockholm With Scandinavian Design<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#luxurious-loft-apartment-in-stockholm-with-scandinavian-design>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Skylight-ushers-in-ventilation-to-the-ensuite-bedroom.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.834u2YPN5_gJAtYvimyy_wHaE7&pid=15.1"' alt="Luxurious Loft Apartment in Stockholm With Scandinavian Design"><p><em>Source: decoist.com</em></p><blockquote><p>loft apartment attic stockholm bedroom ensuite stunning open plan meters square bedrooms skylight views conversion spectacular decoist ventilation ushers modern.</p></blockquote><p>Location of apartments:
