-Make sure your apartment has proper locking mechanisms and that all doors and windows are locked when you leave.
-Check for smoke detectors in each unit and make sure they&rsquo;re functional.
-Make sure any water or gas leaks are repaired immediately.
-Ensure that all cords are properly plugged in, especially those coming from the electrical outlet.</p><h2 id=stanford-court-apartments-apartments---irvine-ca--apartmentscom>Stanford Court Apartments Apartments - Irvine, CA | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#stanford-court-apartments-apartments---irvine-ca--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.apartments.com/i2/7MbK7XO_jKgr5dyTVT2nmx3Uhwt7D1Nn1AwrkE04zCU/117/stanford-court-apartments-irvine-ca-building-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.xbRWpwIiCttIGHnbfLmsuwHaE7&pid=15.1"' alt="Stanford Court Apartments Apartments - Irvine, CA | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>apartments stanford uci court irvine campus building virtual tours.</p></blockquote><p>Apartment location:
