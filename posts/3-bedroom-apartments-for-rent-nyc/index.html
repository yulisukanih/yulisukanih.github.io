A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year. This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years. In order to avoid having to maintain an apartment complex more often than necessary, landlords should consider rat-catching and janitorial services as part of their regular maintenance plan.</p><h2 id=new-york-apartment-1-bedroom-apartment-rental-in-brooklyn-ny-16440>New York Apartment: 1 Bedroom Apartment Rental In Brooklyn (NY-16440)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#new-york-apartment-1-bedroom-apartment-rental-in-brooklyn-ny-16440>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.nyhabitat.com/picture-ny-apt/17581/17581D19.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.NnDBF0ixLSOz19Acca20EQHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt="New York Apartment: 1 Bedroom Apartment Rental in Brooklyn (NY-16440)"><p><em>Source: nyhabitat.com</em></p><blockquote><p>apartment ny york bedroom brooklyn rental.</p></blockquote><p>Section Four: Features of apartments
