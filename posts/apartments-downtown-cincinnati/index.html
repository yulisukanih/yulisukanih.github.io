clean your apartment regularly
There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the frequency of cleaning an apartment will depend on a number of factors, including the type of apartment, its individual condition, and the habits and activities of its residents.

To check whether or not your apartment is in need of cleaning, use one of the following tools:</p><ol><li>A property report card from your building management company</li><li>The keys to your unit</li><li>The monthly maintenance schedule for each unit in your building</li><li>A comparison of tenant reviews online</li><li></li></ol><h2 id=65-west-apartments-cincinnati-oh>65 West Apartments Cincinnati, OH<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#65-west-apartments-cincinnati-oh>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images.rentable.co/20768/15378533/large.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.z8kUTF5DX2JjVAjMsWUQlgHaE7&pid=15.1"' alt="65 West Apartments Cincinnati, OH"><p><em>Source: rentable.co</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Rules of thumb for decorating an apartment
