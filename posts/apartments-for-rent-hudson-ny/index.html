Are apartments becoming more and more popular as a place to live? Or are the demographics of apartment users changing? According to recent data, the answer is both.
This is according to a study conducted by real estate firm CBRE, which found that the number of people using apartments as their primary home has increased by 3% in each of the past five years. Meanwhile, the percentage of people living in apartments with roommates has decreased each year since 2012.</p><p>The reason for this change could be a variety of reasons; some say that people are choosing apartment living because it&rsquo;s more affordable than living with a family member or friend, while others may simply prefer having complete control over all aspects of their life inside an all-encompassing building.</p><h2 id=195-hudson-st-new-york-ny-10013-apartments---new-york-ny>195 Hudson St, New York, NY 10013 Apartments - New York, NY<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#195-hudson-st-new-york-ny-10013-apartments---new-york-ny>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://images1.apartments.com/i2/ujXNHJF-7A6X7E1MrakoAHFjuR1GrezGGEroY-4-9ys/111/195-hudson-st-new-york-ny-building-photo.jpg?p=1" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.DNhharL25DbKEqEkk0oMiAHaJQ&pid=15.1"' alt="195 Hudson St, New York, NY 10013 Apartments - New York, NY"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Types of apartments available

The size of apartments has become a major issue in the city. More people are living in larger, more expensive apartments than ever before. However, the shape of these apartments is also becoming a major issue.
The traditional &ldquo;boxy&rdquo; buildings are being replaced by more slender and elongated buildings. This change has had a significant impact on the concentration of population and businesses in certain areas of the city. Additionally, the use of glass and steel in apartment windows has made it difficult to see out from an apartment window, making it less inviting for residents.</p><p>Despite these challenges, there is still plenty of room for growth in the apartment market.</p><h2 id=hudson-192-apartments-new-york-ny---apartments-for-rent--rentalscom>Hudson 192 Apartments New York, NY - Apartments For Rent | Rentals.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#hudson-192-apartments-new-york-ny---apartments-for-rent--rentalscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://rentpath-res.cloudinary.com/t_rp,cs_tinysrgb,fl_force_strip,w_584,h_432,c_fill,b_rgb:131313,q_auto:best,dpr_1.0/e_unsharp_mask:50/28390292c85f405e463d1bd6d933ca58 onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.rVhcJs-w0Uq0teW2wvCkhQHaFe&pid=15.1"' alt="Hudson 192 Apartments New York, NY - Apartments For Rent | Rentals.com"><p><em>Source: rentals.com</em></p><blockquote><p>apartments.</p></blockquote><p>Parking: How much parking is included in the rent?
