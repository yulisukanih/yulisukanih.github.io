A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year. This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years. In order to avoid having to maintain an apartment complex more often than necessary, landlords should consider rat-catching and janitorial services as part of their regular maintenance plan.</p><h2 id=bloomfield-apartments---concord-ca--apartmentscom>Bloomfield Apartments - Concord, CA | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#bloomfield-apartments---concord-ca--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://images1.apartments.com/i2/yxVTxduM9o3DaHLHkWMYhdmFvvFf-MA4DYH_B3Gix74/117/bloomfield-apartments-concord-ca-building-photo.jpg?p=1" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.vDttW0k3uc-RJTLhBJDOHQHaJ4&pid=15.1"' alt="Bloomfield Apartments - Concord, CA | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>bloomfield concord.</p></blockquote><h2 id=el-prado-apartments---san-francisco-ca--apartmentscom>El Prado Apartments - San Francisco, CA | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#el-prado-apartments---san-francisco-ca--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://images1.apartments.com/i2/AoBkd5gAImXETe3P9ba0S2grgfmxLByDSke1g4Nbn1E/117/el-prado-apartments-san-francisco-ca-building-photo.jpg?p=1" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Py0G_OzLNdzF0I5HaNP8qQHaIr&pid=15.1"' alt="El Prado Apartments - San Francisco, CA | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>What is an apartment and why should you consider one?
An apartment is a rental property that typically provides one or more bedrooms, living spaces, and a kitchenette. Apartments are a great way to find affordable housing in a city or town. They can be rented out for short-term rentals, as well.
Apartments come in different sizes and styles. Some have larger living areas with kitchenettes, while others have smaller bedrooms and kitchens. The key thing to keep in mind when choosing an apartment is the space it provides. If you need more than one bedroom, make sure the apartment has at least two of those!</p><h2 id=apartments-for-rent-in-berkeley-ca--zillow-2>Apartments For Rent In Berkeley CA | Zillow<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#apartments-for-rent-in-berkeley-ca--zillow-2>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://photos.zillowstatic.com/p_e/IS6iplhmonlt7e0000000000.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.dAVDu-BdnsSXqjObCIy5cQHaFi&pid=15.1"' alt="Apartments For Rent in Berkeley CA | Zillow"><p><em>Source: zillow.com</em></p><blockquote><p>berkeley.</p></blockquote><p>Heat/ cooling systems:
Heat-returning air conditioning systems (HRSAs) are commonly used in apartments to keep the living areas and corridors cool during the summer months. They can be very effective at cooling down large areas, but they can also be a nuisance if left on for too long. To avoid waking up your roommate in the middle of the night, it is important to set up your HRSA wisely.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://yulisukanih.github.io/posts/the-landmark-apartments/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Landmark Apartments - Suffolk Theater, National Landmark – Art &amp;amp; Architecture Quarterly</span></a>
