Regularly checking for new leaks, fixing broken parts, and replacing filters can all help keep your unit habitable.</p></li><li><p>Cleaning and painting: Keeping your building spick and span means cleaning every nook and cranny – from the landing boards to the toilet seats – every week or so.</p></li></ol><h2 id=100-best-apartments-in-kansas-city-mo-with-reviews--rentcafé-1>100 Best Apartments In Kansas City, MO (with Reviews) | RENTCafé<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#100-best-apartments-in-kansas-city-mo-with-reviews--rentcafé-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://cdngeneral.rentcafe.com/dmslivecafe/2/58213/apartments_in_kansas_city_exterior.jpg?width=350" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.ES_VNeBVDkOzb-o8Uc9y1AAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="100 Best Apartments in Kansas City, MO (with reviews) | RENTCafé"><p><em>Source: rentcafe.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Benefits of apartments:
