Here are six tips to help make the decision:</p><ol><li><p>Measure your needs: When measuring your needs, it&rsquo;s important to take into account what kind of living space you&rsquo;ll be using and how much space you&rsquo;ll have within your budget. A one-bedroom apartment might not be enough for someone who wants a lot of extra storage space, while a two-bedroom might fit more people comfortably.</p></li><li><p>Compare prices: It&rsquo;s also important to compare prices before signing a lease. Different areas have different rent rates and may require a higher or lower down payment than others.</p></li></ol><h2 id=landmark-on-grand-river---east-lansing-mi--apartment-finder>Landmark On Grand River - East Lansing, MI | Apartment Finder<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#landmark-on-grand-river---east-lansing-mi--apartment-finder>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://image1.apartmentfinder.com/i2/q_xn5Bda_dXwsWMT3KIdWvXockPhEYhe4ubznsdeuzw/110/landmark-on-grand-river-east-lansing-mi-primary-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.ZzJRn57bbvszujEiLTZfNwHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="Landmark on Grand River - East Lansing, MI | Apartment Finder"><p><em>Source: apartmentfinder.com</em></p><blockquote><p>lansing east grand river mi apartments landmark tours 3d.</p></blockquote><p>Benefits of apartments over houses
