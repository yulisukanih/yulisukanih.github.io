Here is an overview of the different types of apartments:</p></li><li><p>Rentals: rental apartments are places where you live while you&rsquo;re looking for a place to rent. They come in all shapes and sizes, and often have specific rules about who can rent them to. Some popular rental buildings include hotels, condos, and apartment buildings.</p></li><li><p>Buying: buying an apartment is a bit different than renting one. You can buy an apartment outright, or invest in it through a real estate company that will help you find properties that fit your needs and budget.</p></li></ol><h2 id=1-bedroom-apartments-for-rent-in-las-cruces-nm--apartmentscom>1 Bedroom Apartments For Rent In Las Cruces NM | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-bedroom-apartments-for-rent-in-las-cruces-nm--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.apartments.com/i2/cfCbR-me2aAgWIqn4zXGvi0Hvmb7qmCFWZg727iz4uU/117/image.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.qcSEBXIRnBJYPEIXFkb2zAHaEK&pid=15.1"' alt="1 Bedroom Apartments for Rent in Las Cruces NM | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>apartments cruces nm las.</p></blockquote><p>What is an apartment?
An apartment is a rental property.

Apartments provide a variety of benefits to tenants. These benefits can include:</p><ol><li><p>Reduced rent costs: A landlord can reduce their monthly rent by providing an apartment. This is because an apartment is larger and more expensive than a rental unit that is not an apartment.</p></li><li><p>Increased security: With apartments, tenants have more potential peace of mind knowing that the building has a locksmith and 24-hour security. This increased security can make it difficult for anyone to break into an apartment.</p></li><li><p>More affordable living space: If an apartment is large enough, it may be cheaper to live in one than in multiple rental units. This is because each individual tenant pays only a portion of the monthly rent, which means that landlords are free to charge whatever they want for their units.</p></li></ol><h2 id=los-amigos---las-cruces-nm--apartment-finder>Los Amigos - Las Cruces, NM | Apartment Finder<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#los-amigos---las-cruces-nm--apartment-finder>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://image1.apartmentfinder.com/i2/XfMomtZpRqQI7XmGoVjQCMcwgThDJIAd6K5Kie0zuE4/117/los-amigos-las-cruces-nm-primary-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cNqMzARE0W38TyCM4UK2RQHaGB&pid=15.1"' alt="Los Amigos - Las Cruces, NM | Apartment Finder"><p><em>Source: apartmentfinder.com</em></p><blockquote><p>cruces forrent.</p></blockquote><p>experiences with apartments
