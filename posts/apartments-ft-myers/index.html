Apartments can be a great place to live, but they come with a few important security and maintenance tips. Here are three tips to keep your apartment safe and humming:</p><ol><li><p>Make sure all systems are up and running - make sure the building&rsquo;s utilities are hooked up, the locks are set, and any windows or doors are locked.</p></li><li><p>Keep your property clean - often times apartments have limited resources so it&rsquo;s important to keep them clean as well. Sweep the floors, dust furniture, vacuum the floorboards - anything that can help reduce potential risks.</p></li><li><p>Be aware of your surroundings - if you see something suspicious or hear something mysterious, reach out to security or call police!</p></li></ol><h2 id=new-luxury-apartments-in-fort-myers--81-west-apartments--home-1>New Luxury Apartments In Fort Myers | 81 West Apartments | Home<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#new-luxury-apartments-in-fort-myers--81-west-apartments--home-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.ampresidential.com/uploads/images/images/639x639h/607687/10.png?1606945012 onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.WKY7I1O14hS69KWqIyzz4wHaHa&pid=15.1"' alt="New Luxury Apartments in Fort Myers | 81 West Apartments | Home"><p><em>Source: ampresidential.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are a popular form of housing in many parts of the world.
