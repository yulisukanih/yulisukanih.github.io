Apartments have a long and proud history, dating back to the ancient Greeks and Romans. They were not only used as living quarters for elites, but also became a key part of society as a way to better manage and protect their citizens.
Since the early days of apartment buildings, they have been designed to be luxurious and inviting, making them ideal for those who desire privacy and comfort. A few notable examples from throughout history include the Star-Kist Building in New York City, which was built in 1907 as a luxury hotel. Additionally, The Ritz-Carlton Hotel in London was one of the first buildings to be occupied by tenants with apartments on top.</p><p>In recent years, apartment buildings have become even more popular, with many people looking for an affordable lifestyle closer to their work or home.</p><h2 id=harlem-apartments---new-york-ny--apartment-finder>Harlem Apartments - New York, NY | Apartment Finder<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#harlem-apartments---new-york-ny--apartment-finder>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://image2.apartmentfinder.com/i2/bXoRlJJIcTXb4i5QFsUFzwm3NCmEHIX4LbAHlpiwno0/117/harlem-apartments-new-york-ny-building-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Lhgd59U3v6hCkOv6sj-siwHaLH&pid=15.1"' alt="Harlem Apartments - New York, NY | Apartment Finder"><p><em>Source: apartmentfinder.com</em></p><blockquote><p>harlem apartments york apartment ny.</p></blockquote><p>Heat and cooling:
