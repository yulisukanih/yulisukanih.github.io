Apartments are a type of housing that is designed to be inhabited by one or more people. They can come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and they can be rented out or bought. In some ways, apartments are similar to houses, but they are usually less expensive to live in. They also offer a range of facilities, such as kitchens and living rooms, that make them ideal for tenants.</p><h2 id=brighton-apartment-for-rent-2-bedrooms-2-baths-boston---4975-1>Brighton Apartment For Rent 2 Bedrooms 2 Baths Boston - $4,975<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#brighton-apartment-for-rent-2-bedrooms-2-baths-boston---4975-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://m.bostonpads.com/media/v2/listings/boston-brighton-north-brighton/photos/09-22/1662572184-asdf.PNG?auto=format,compress&q=80" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIF.H1flm8AY06pPNKdckIY2Pg&pid=15.1"' alt="Brighton Apartment for rent 2 Bedrooms 2 Baths Boston - $4,975"><p><em>Source: bostonpads.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Heat and cooling:
