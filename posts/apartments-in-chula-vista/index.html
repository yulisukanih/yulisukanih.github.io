A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year. This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years. In order to avoid having to maintain an apartment complex more often than necessary, landlords should consider rat-catching and janitorial services as part of their regular maintenance plan.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://yulisukanih.github.io/posts/apartments-for-rent-in-naples-florida/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Apartments For Rent In Naples Florida : Naples Restricted</span></a>
