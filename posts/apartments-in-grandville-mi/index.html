An apartment is a large, often cooperative, group of rooms or units used for living and working. It can be single- or double-occupy, and typically includes one bedroom and one or more bathrooms. In the United States, apartments are most commonly found in suburban areas.
There are many factors to consider when managing an apartment, including security and noise control. Security measures include ensuring that doors and windows are locked at all times, maintaining an effective fire alarm system, and installing security sensors to detect movement of guests or other unauthorized users.
