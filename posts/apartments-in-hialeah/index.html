Rental rates are always changing, but the most popular types of apartments continue to be units that rent for a set amount of time, regardless of how often they may be rented. The terms &ldquo;rent&rdquo; and &ldquo;lease&rdquo; are often used interchangeably when talking about rental rates, but there are important distinctions to make. Renting an apartment generally means that you will be living in it for an entire period of time- usually between one and six months.
