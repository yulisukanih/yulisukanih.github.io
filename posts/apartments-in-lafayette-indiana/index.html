Here are three tips to keep your apartment safe and humming:</p><ol><li><p>Make sure all systems are up and running - make sure the building&rsquo;s utilities are hooked up, the locks are set, and any windows or doors are locked.</p></li><li><p>Keep your property clean - often times apartments have limited resources so it&rsquo;s important to keep them clean as well. Sweep the floors, dust furniture, vacuum the floorboards - anything that can help reduce potential risks.</p></li><li><p>Be aware of your surroundings - if you see something suspicious or hear something mysterious, reach out to security or call police!</p></li></ol><h2 id=shenandoah-properties-apartments---lafayette-in--apartmentscom>Shenandoah Properties Apartments - Lafayette, IN | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#shenandoah-properties-apartments---lafayette-in--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://images1.apartments.com/i2/AzJme4GtUDfDOoVWdT4Fge2OErWgOf672irNl36uFNE/117/shenandoah-properties-lafayette-in-bedroom.jpg?p=1" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.RZsELZomm0eQjEh-1taYIAHaE7&pid=15.1"' alt="Shenandoah Properties Apartments - Lafayette, IN | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>shenandoah.</p></blockquote><p>Size and layout of apartments: How many people can live in an apartment
The average apartment size in the United States is 3,000 square feet. This size is large enough for most people to live comfortably but not so large that it becomes overwhelming. Some apartment buildings offer larger sizes, while others are smaller. When looking to buy an apartment, be sure to research the size and layout of the building before you decide on one.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://yulisukanih.github.io/posts/apartments-in-boca-raton-fl/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Apartments In Boca Raton Fl : Boca Crossroads Downtown Raton Apartments</span></a>
