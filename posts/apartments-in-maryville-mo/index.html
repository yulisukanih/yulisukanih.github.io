Here are three tips for keeping your apartment safe:</p><ol><li>Keep your door locked when you leave and when you come back in. This will help protect yourself and your belongings from thieves.</li><li>Make sure your apartment is well-lit at all times. This will make it easier for anyone who may be looking for you while you&rsquo;re away.</li><li>Keep your windows closed and never leave your door open if you have a dog or cat. This will help keep them safe from getting into trouble while you&rsquo;re away.</li></ol><h2 id=oak-pointe-of-maryville--seniorlivingcom>Oak Pointe Of Maryville | SeniorLiving.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#oak-pointe-of-maryville--seniorlivingcom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://www.seniorliving.com/sites/default/files/styles/flexslider_full/public/senior-community/1266171/original_4.png?itok=B2Yl0K4L" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.wR-5pUyOgF9PZztfNUoy_wHaEo&pid=15.1"' alt="Oak Pointe of Maryville | SeniorLiving.com"><p><em>Source: seniorliving.com</em></p><blockquote><p>maryville seniorliving assisted offering.</p></blockquote><p>Conclusion: Is living in an apartment a good decision for you?

For example, a studio apartment could be used for someone who only needs one room and is not interested in having a full sized home.
