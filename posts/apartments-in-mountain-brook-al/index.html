Apartments provide a variety of benefits to tenants. These benefits can include:</p><ol><li><p>Reduced rent costs: A landlord can reduce their monthly rent by providing an apartment. This is because an apartment is larger and more expensive than a rental unit that is not an apartment.</p></li><li><p>Increased security: With apartments, tenants have more potential peace of mind knowing that the building has a locksmith and 24-hour security. This increased security can make it difficult for anyone to break into an apartment.</p></li><li><p>More affordable living space: If an apartment is large enough, it may be cheaper to live in one than in multiple rental units. This is because each individual tenant pays only a portion of the monthly rent, which means that landlords are free to charge whatever they want for their units.</p></li></ol><h2 id=mountain-brook-al-real-estate---mountain-brook-homes-for-sale-3>Mountain Brook, AL Real Estate - Mountain Brook Homes For Sale<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#mountain-brook-al-real-estate---mountain-brook-homes-for-sale-3>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://ap.rdcpix.com/43355d3ef99da34a6fc149ef2d764780l-m15834533od-w480_h360_x2.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.tBLOutVfxtOa5K6a0LMcUQHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="Mountain Brook, AL Real Estate - Mountain Brook Homes for Sale"><p><em>Source: realtor.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>What is an apartment?
