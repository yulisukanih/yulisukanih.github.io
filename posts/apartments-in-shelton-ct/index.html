When is an apartment good?
There are a lot of factors to consider when choosing an apartment, but location is usually one of the most important. Location can be determined by a variety of factors such as the price of rent, the size and shape of the apartments, and the distance from public transportation.</p><p>Some people believe that apartments in desirable locations are worth more than apartments in less desirable locations. This is because a better location often means more opportunities for activities and cultural experiences that can make up for a lower rent price.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for an apartment with unique features or someone who will be living there long-term, it&rsquo;s important to look at the location before settling on any options.</p><h2 id=shelton-ct-houses-for-rent---52-houses--rentcom>Shelton, CT Houses For Rent - 52 Houses | Rent.com®<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#shelton-ct-houses-for-rent---52-houses--rentcom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://rentpath-res.cloudinary.com/t_rp,cs_tinysrgb,fl_force_strip,w_400,h_240,c_fill,q_auto:low,dpr_1.0,e_improve/e_unsharp_mask:50/3f7fafe5bc3ccc2517b98ab89d332acf onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Vb0XrLclFMxeghbBqs3WYgAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Shelton, CT Houses for Rent - 52 Houses | Rent.com®"><p><em>Source: rent.com</em></p><blockquote><p>shelton oakview.</p></blockquote><p>An apartment is a small, two-story building where people live.
