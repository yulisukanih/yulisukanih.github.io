Apartment building types vary greatly in size, configuration and amenities. This can make it difficult to know which one is the right fit for you. To help you determine which type of apartment is right for you, we have created a classification system.
The following classesifications are based on the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that an apartment offers.</p><p>One-bedroom apartments offer one bedroom and a bathroom. These units are typically used as studios or as transitional housing for lower-income residents.</p><p>Two-bedroom apartments offer two bedrooms and a bathroom. These units are typically used as apartments for married couples or families with children.
2 3 4 bed apartments offer three bedrooms and a bathroom each. They are used as singles or in combination with smaller one-bedroom apartments to form larger single or multiple unit housing arrangements.</p><h2 id=university-apartments>University Apartments<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#university-apartments>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://tours.scdn4.secure.raxcdn.com/tourplaythumb.php?width=1200&height=630&tourtype=fsd&nol=1&mediaId=6241687" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.EXzH3D_BwBsr1G1MP7jFYgHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt="University Apartments"><p><em>Source: fusion.realtourvision.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are a type of housing that can be found in many places around the world.
