Small apartments can have one or two bedrooms, while larger properties may have three or four bedrooms. The size of a bedroom affects both the number of bedrooms and the amount of living space that is available. The layout of a bedroom also affects the amount of space that is available for storage.
The layout of a bedroom also affects how comfortable it will be to sleep in. A small bedroom with a shared hallway between it and the rest of the apartment will likely be less comfortable than one with its own hallway and separate bed room.
This difference in comfort can lead to different people sleeping in different rooms at night, which could lead to noise problems or other peacocking issues.</p><h2 id=houses-for-rent-in-thousand-oaks-ca---rentdigscom--page-2>Houses For Rent In Thousand Oaks, CA - RentDigs.com | Page 2<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#houses-for-rent-in-thousand-oaks-ca---rentdigscom--page-2>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.sublet.com/aptimages/4477873_1.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.mSJzbYOdxbO3Af_9n492qgAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Houses for Rent in Thousand Oaks, CA - RentDigs.com | Page 2"><p><em>Source: rentdigs.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Maintenance and care: How often should an apartment be checked/cleaned?
