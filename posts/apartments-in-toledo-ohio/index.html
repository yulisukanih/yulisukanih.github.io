There are many types of landlords, depending on what type of apartment they are evicting.
Tenants who live in apartments should be aware of the following:
-A landlord is not limited to one type of apartment, and can evict a tenant for any reason.
-If an apartment is not fit for habitation, the landlord can sell it to another tenant or demolish it.
-Apartments are usually divided into two categories: &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; and &ldquo;floating.&rdquo; Fixed apartments are typically rented out month-to-month, while floating apartments allow for monthly rent but may also be available for lease or purchase.
Tenants who live in fixed apartments should be aware that they can&rsquo;t move out unless they get a new lease or break their current lease.</p><h2 id=photos-of-perry039s-crossing-apartments-in-perrysburg-ohio>Photos Of Perry's Crossing Apartments In Perrysburg, Ohio<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#photos-of-perry039s-crossing-apartments-in-perrysburg-ohio>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://g5-assets-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,fl_lossy/v1581722467/g5/g5-c-5befy22d4-morgan-properties/g5-cl-1k2f51hsu3-perry-s-crossing-apartments/uploads/TLD-PRK-002-WB-edit_cb1roj.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.IzNldyfO9as9LWdLoMBmcgHaEc&pid=15.1"' alt="Photos of Perry's Crossing Apartments in Perrysburg, Ohio"><p><em>Source: morgan-properties.com</em></p><blockquote><p>toledo townhomes steeplechase perrysburg.</p></blockquote><p>What are the different types of apartments?
