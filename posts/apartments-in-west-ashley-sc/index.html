Most come with a kitchenette and one or two bathrooms.</li><li>Condos- These are large, five or six-bedroom apartments that sit on a large lot. They often come with gardens, private balconies, and robust security systems.</li><li>Townhouses- These are similar to condos but they are smaller and more condensed - often having only two or three bedrooms and one or two bathrooms.
