Here&rsquo;s a look at some key costs associated with living in an apartment:
Monthly Rent:</p><p>As a general rule, apartments cost more when located near urban areas or within walking distance of a shopping mall or movie theater. However, there are exceptions to this rule - for example, if the property islicense-restricted or has limited parking spaces.
