Homelessness and apartment homelessness are two issues that face homelessness organizations all over the United States. In 2013, there were an estimated 45,000 homeless people living in apartments. Additionally, as homeless populations continue to grow, so too do the rates of apartment homelessness.
The problem with apartment homelessness is that it can be difficult for people who are homeless to find a place to live. Often, landlords do not consider people who are homeless when making decisions about how to manage their property. This leaves homeless people without any options other than sleeping on the streets or in shelters.</p><p>In addition to being difficult for those who are Homeless to find places to sleep, apartments also provide little opportunity for those who are experiencing poverty or low income. When someone is living in an apartment without any food or shelter, it can be difficult for them to access necessary services like healthcare and education.</p><h2 id=university-towers-apartments---norfolk-va--apartmentscom>University Towers Apartments - Norfolk, VA | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#university-towers-apartments---norfolk-va--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://images1.apartments.com/i2/nCco4xpBfmmLBVvndLKTBvGr_TurMFeuBBGoXZRbau0/117/university-towers-norfolk-va-two-bedroom-kitchen.jpg?p=1" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.kfqYTKkcdPdA5a7jIU_RJgHaE7&pid=15.1"' alt="University Towers Apartments - Norfolk, VA | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>university apartments norfolk va towers.</p></blockquote><p>Problems with apartments
