These benefits can include:\nReduced rent costs: A landlord can reduce their monthly rent by providing an apartment. This is because an apartment is larger and more expensive than a rental unit that is not an apartment.\nIncreased security: With apartments, tenants have more potential peace of mind knowing that the building has a locksmith and 24-hour security. This increased security can make it difficult for anyone to break into an apartment.\nMore affordable living space: If an apartment is large enough, it may be cheaper to live in one than in multiple rental units.
