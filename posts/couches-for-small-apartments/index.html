Today, apartment communities are a common sight in many American cities. But according to a report from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the number of apartments available for rent will be at an all-time low by 2029. This could have a significant impact on city life, as well as the economy.
The report&rsquo;s authors say that apartment buildings are becoming increasingly scarce, and that this is likely due to Falling home values and population growth. With more people crammed into smaller spaces, it&rsquo;s become harder for developers to find space to build new units. In order to meet demand, some landlords are asking tenants to pay more money for their apartments than they would normally do.</p><p>This problem is only going to get worse in the future – and as apartment communities near their end, it&rsquo;s likely that these buildings will not be replaced by new ones.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://yulisukanih.github.io/posts/burien-apartments/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Burien Apartments - The Court At Northgate Apartments</span></a>
