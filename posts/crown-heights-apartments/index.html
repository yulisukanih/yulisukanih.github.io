Financing an apartment can be tricky, but there are a few key things to keep in mind if you&rsquo;re planning on getting one. The first thing to think about is your budget. You&rsquo;ll want to figure out how much you can afford to spend on rent and other expenses each month, and then compare that against the monthly mortgage or lease payments you&rsquo;ll need to make. Next, consider the size of your apartment. If you&rsquo;re looking for a smaller rental property, it might be easier to get a mortgage or lease with a shorter term than if you&rsquo;re looking for a larger one.
