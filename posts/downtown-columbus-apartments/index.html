There are many types of landlords, from apartment landlords to hotel landlords. Each has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Here are four keytypes of apartment landlords:</p><ol><li><p>Tenant-in-possession (TIP): These landlords take on the responsibility of managing the property on behalf of their tenants. This can include checking in on residents, cleaning up after meals, and maintaining utilities. The biggest benefit to TIP landlords is that they typically have a much longer lease term than other types of landlord, making sure that tenants stay with them for as long as possible.</p></li><li><p>roommates only: These landlords allow tenants to live together but do notrent out the entire unit.instead, each tenant rents out a specific portion of their room or suite.</p></li></ol><h2 id=the-city--apartments-in-columbus-oh>The City | Apartments In Columbus, OH<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-city--apartments-in-columbus-oh>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://resource.rentcafe.com/image/upload/w_1484,h_1000/q_auto,f_auto,c_lfill,w_576,ar_1.428/s3/2/85591/img_4841-website(1).jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.c4Lpoja14AShZSn57GduywHaFL&pid=15.1"' alt="The City | Apartments in Columbus, OH"><p><em>Source: liveatthecity.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments can be a great way to live if you have a small budget.
