Apartments are one of the most common places to live in the United States. With an average of 2,000 apartments per capita, they offer a great place to live and raise a family. However, apartment complexes can be a risky place to live. There are a variety of factors that can make apartment complexes less safe for residents, and some have even gone so far as to call them “shady” or “unsafe.”
One of the most important things that residents should do when living in an apartment complex is to be aware of their surroundings. This way, they can avoid being alone in unfamiliar areas and/or being approached by someone who may want to harm them. Additionally, it is important to beaware of any hidden dangers that may exist inside an apartment complex.</p><h2 id=masonvale-apartments---fairfax-va-22030>Masonvale Apartments - Fairfax, VA 22030<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#masonvale-apartments---fairfax-va-22030>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://rentpath-res.cloudinary.com/w_370,h_370,t_rp,cs_tinysrgb,fl_force_strip,c_fill/e_unsharp_mask:50,q_auto/30301e37fb8ae191cb1f4aac971c0fa3 onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.9uOAaL9vtFuYof6QRdlxhwAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Masonvale Apartments - Fairfax, VA 22030"><p><em>Source: apartmentguide.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Development opportunities for apartment complexes:
