There are many factors to consider when judging an apartment, but one of the most important is its quality. One way to determine whether an apartment is good or not is to look at the standards set by the apartment building or association. If the building or association has high standards, then the apartments will likely be of good quality. However, if the standards are lower, then the apartments may not be as good as they should be. It is important to check these standards before choosing an apartment, so that you can be sure that you are getting what you expect.</p><h2 id=the-fountains-apartments>The Fountains Apartments<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-fountains-apartments>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="http://images3.aptcdn.com/attachment/the-fountains-apartments-dallas-tx/5wlhfrn/?x=C856E3EA42F55431ADA4BB37C0BB6D911DC2F35A74E2AAEE13F706D74EE8D9B8EE45C2CEE68F05ECDC3487AF273E42250729E6FD35F143CA7EDC1FF02FB2143346CAFD892A514A0D96E59A17BDE173B1D2605D25CEE084B0F32365A5FD38E477704BD37C07493CCA438CB9F3415A0A1B16C37F57EBA4F10ECE27FB3438BF9887244BADE5AA54967F40DA08ECC1548CA4C4D6016D61ABD22FFBCC12BAAD72F44A65AFE0DA47B9C2E01773A8652E3528D37D514E9E91C3003720B21EE4FAF9D1C8531E8D7E6B80A04C95F6121B6143C5B0AB69D455E35AD1AB03416A3A414DBCA8" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.h5lkwfDEpYCzvJEqPY_4FgHaFB&pid=15.1"' alt="The Fountains Apartments"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>apartments fountains 1ba 1br.</p></blockquote><p>Apartment Parking:
