Looking for a safe place to live? pamper yourself with the perfect apartment for your needs. Whether you&rsquo;re looking for a one-bedroom or two-bedroom, an online platform like Airbnb can provide you with rental listings in your area. With so many choices to choose from, it&rsquo;s important to be sure that the property you&rsquo;re considering is reputable and has secure locks and alarms. Here are five tips to help make sure your new apartment is just as safe as possible: 1. Do your research before making a purchase. Don&rsquo;t let someone else take advantage of your naiveté and tell you that because their property is &ldquo;safe,&rdquo; it must be too. Check out the ratings of the apartments in your area on real estate websites like Zillow and Gletto, then compare prices and features before making a decision. 2.</p><h2 id=221-glenridge-ave-st-catharines---apartment-for-rent>221 Glenridge Ave., St. Catharines - Apartment For Rent<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#221-glenridge-ave-st-catharines---apartment-for-rent>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.rentcompass.com/ShareImage/B71184 onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.e5pRc79XXcI7SY7aPWqUggHaD4&pid=15.1"' alt="221 glenridge ave., st. catharines - Apartment for Rent"><p><em>Source: rentcompass.com</em></p><blockquote><p>catharines st ave glenridge rent.</p></blockquote><p>Types of apartments: single, double, triple and quadruple occupancy
