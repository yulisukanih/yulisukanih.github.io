Renting an apartment generally means that you will be living in it for an entire period of time- usually between one and six months. Leases on the other hand, can be for a shorter or longer period- typically one to three years.
Most apartments these days come with some type of agreement in place in order to ensure that you will be living in them for at least the minimum length of time required by the lease.</p><h2 id=greystone-apartments-tuscumbia-al---rent-the-shoals>Greystone Apartments Tuscumbia AL - Rent The Shoals<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#greystone-apartments-tuscumbia-al---rent-the-shoals>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://renttheshoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Indian-Creek-Ext-8289-300x199.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.__7H1MV6dEA08YAfIxV-xwAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Greystone Apartments Tuscumbia AL - Rent The Shoals"><p><em>Source: renttheshoals.com</em></p><blockquote><p>tuscumbia greystone.</p></blockquote><p>Types of apartments:
