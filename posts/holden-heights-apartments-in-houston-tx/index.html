The minimum requirements for apartments vary depending on the city or town in which they are located. In some cases, the apartment must have an entrance, a balcony or other outdoor space, and be able to hold at least four people.
In other cases, the apartment may only require one or two bedrooms, with kitchen and bathroom facilities being included.
