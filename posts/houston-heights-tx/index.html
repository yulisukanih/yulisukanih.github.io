Pets can be a lifesaver for apartments. They provide companionship and safety, as well as some added features like providing fresh air and exercise. However, there are a few things to consider before getting a pet. Here are three tips:</p><ol><li><p>Check with your apartment complex if they allow pets. Some complexes may have rules about owning pets, while others may not have any restrictions at all. It’s important to ask if your building has any regulations in place that impact the care and well-being of your pet.</p></li><li><p>Get a pet that is compatible with your lifestyle and budget.
