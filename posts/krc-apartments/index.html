They work to keep everything running smoothly, and they make sure that all residents are taken care of as best they can. They also work to improve the appearance of the complex, so that everyone feels comfortable and safe.</p><p>In addition to their work on site, maintenance and repair staff also have to be available 24/7 in order to help with anything that needs attention.</p><h2 id=krc-hilltops-apartments---norcross-ga-30071-1>KRC Hilltops Apartments - Norcross, GA 30071<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#krc-hilltops-apartments---norcross-ga-30071-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://rentpath-res.cloudinary.com/w_277,h_191,t_rp,cs_tinysrgb,fl_force_strip,c_fill/e_unsharp_mask:50,q_auto/5ce659583577ec0b0929d72dcba5c7f6 onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.v5lJZzDi4jDecYK7d_CvRAAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="KRC Hilltops Apartments - Norcross, GA 30071"><p><em>Source: apartmentguide.com</em></p><blockquote><p>hilltops krc norcross.</p></blockquote><p>Types of Apartments: Flat, Loft, and Condo
