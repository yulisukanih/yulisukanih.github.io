Here are five tips to help you choose the right one:</p><ol><li><p>Look at the location: Get a good view of the city or town you’re interested in. You’ll want to find an apartment with plenty of natural light, so please don’t choose an apartment with small windows or darkness at all hours.</p></li><li><p>Check the size: Make sure the apartment is large enough for your needs. You don’t want to be cramped up in an tiny space or live in a tiny building with no room for anything else.</p></li><li></li></ol><h2 id=lohi-apartment-bldg-apartments---denver-co--apartmentscom>LoHi Apartment Bldg Apartments - Denver, CO | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#lohi-apartment-bldg-apartments---denver-co--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.apartments.com/i2/nGwNOx1iRTju0qXHkzix5xe1bGlGB3DVBf9Go3G85XY/117/lohi-apartment-bldg-denver-co-building-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.LJXT2kc_O653ghz4_19VIgHaFy&pid=15.1"' alt="LoHi Apartment Bldg Apartments - Denver, CO | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>lohi.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments have become a popular choice for people who want to live alone or in a small group.

Apartment building types vary greatly in size, configuration and amenities. This can make it difficult to know which one is the right fit for you. To help you determine which type of apartment is right for you, we have created a classification system.
The following classesifications are based on the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that an apartment offers.</p><p>One-bedroom apartments offer one bedroom and a bathroom. These units are typically used as studios or as transitional housing for lower-income residents.</p><p>Two-bedroom apartments offer two bedrooms and a bathroom.
