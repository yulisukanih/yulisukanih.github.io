Apartments can be either rooms or condos. Rooms are usually smaller and less luxurious than condos, but they&rsquo;re also more affordable. For example, a two-bedroom apartment might cost around $800 while a three-bedroom may cost well over $1,000. A room in an apartment is also often the perfect size for one person to sleep in.</p><h2 id=washburn---7502-doane-drive---house-for-rent-in-madison-al-1>Washburn - 7502 Doane Drive - House For Rent In Madison, AL<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#washburn---7502-doane-drive---house-for-rent-in-madison-al-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://images1.apartments.com/i2/sOeE6CE8CqENMirxq2u2zQ_XZ56zi4ZRJXG3EI_yxVk/117/washburn---7502-doane-drive-madison-al-building-photo.jpg?p=1" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIF.tosjDz55QigYcotQ4l4R4w&pid=15.1"' alt="Washburn - 7502 Doane Drive - House for Rent in Madison, AL"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Classification:

If you&rsquo;re looking for a place to call your own, an apartment may be the answer. In fact, according to a report from apartment research site RENTCafé, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in America is $2,451 per month – which works out to be just over $30 per day. And while it may seem like an expensive proposition, there are plenty of ways to save on rent without moving out of your comfort zone.
For one, consider sleeping in your own bed instead of sharing a bedroom with someone else. Not only does this make living alone more affordable, but it also allows you to get more done in a shorter amount of time – meaning you can spend more time with loved ones.</p><h2 id=photos-and-video-of-avenue-madison-in-madison-al>Photos And Video Of Avenue Madison In Madison, AL<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#photos-and-video-of-avenue-madison-in-madison-al>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://cdngeneralcf.rentcafe.com/dmslivecafe/2/21646/The-Avenue-Madison-Gramercy-Two-Bedroom-Two-Bath-1095-1147-Sq-Ft-Bedroom.jpg?&quality=85&" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.YFhoxMSax1KFxkSh8jsA8gHaEK&pid=15.1"' alt="Photos and Video of Avenue Madison in Madison, AL"><p><em>Source: myavenuemadison.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Size and layout: What are some common apartment features?
