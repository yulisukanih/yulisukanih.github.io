Here are three of the most important reasons why apartments are gaining popularity:</p><ol><li>They&rsquo;re affordable: Most apartments can be found for much cheaper than traditional homes. This is due to the fact that apartment buildings often come with lower monthly fees, and many also offer discounts on amenities like water and cable services.</li><li>They&rsquo;re spacious: Many apartment buildings are specially designed for multiple families or groups of friends. This allows people to easily connect and share living space with others.</li></ol><h2 id=tone-on-tuesday-homeless-wash-up-all-a-homeless-person-needs-is-a>Tone On Tuesday: Homeless Wash-up “All A Homeless Person Needs, Is A<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tone-on-tuesday-homeless-wash-up-all-a-homeless-person-needs-is-a>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="http://www.architectureanddesign.com.au/getmedia/ee9ef731-ab22-4949-9b48-82fa4e4863b0/ToT-68-homeless-title-image.aspx?width=596&height=451&ext=.png" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.eNIT_w213kUNmfU8Pr7LlQAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Tone on Tuesday: Homeless wash-up “All a homeless person needs, is a"><p><em>Source: architectureanddesign.com.au</em></p><blockquote><p>homeless.</p></blockquote><p>Types of apartments: Jane’s Apartment, Edward Jones Apartment, Townhome, and Condo
