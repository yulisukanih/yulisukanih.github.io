Additionally, some apartments offer larger discounts if they are rented months in advance.</p><h2 id=epic-apartment-search-ends-with-200-square-feet-in-chelsea---curbed-ny>Epic Apartment Search Ends With 200 Square Feet In Chelsea - Curbed NY<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#epic-apartment-search-ends-with-200-square-feet-in-chelsea---curbed-ny>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R3rTYLoLxMVQ-k0xtGIRvt4ZKh8=/0x52:1000x615/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/47940173/1502165204.0.0.jpg" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.vkwPIoCmCTM5DU_xIg5mPQHaEK&pid=15.1"' alt="Epic Apartment Search Ends With 200 Square Feet in Chelsea - Curbed NY"><p><em>Source: ny.curbed.com</em></p><blockquote><p>200 square apartment feet.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are a popular form of housing in the United States.
