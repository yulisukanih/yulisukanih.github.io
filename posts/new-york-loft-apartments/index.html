Generally speaking, pets are not allowed in apartments, but there is a wide range of exceptions depending on the apartment complex. Some complexes may allow pets while others may not. It is always best to check with the management of an apartment complex before making a decision about whether or not your pet can live in your unit.</p><h2 id=new-york-loft-apartment--houseidea>New York Loft Apartment. | Houseidea<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#new-york-loft-apartment--houseidea>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://houseidea.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/new-york-loft-apartment-07.jpg?w=150" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP._tW-3xibV_45TZtnULNQTQAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="New York Loft Apartment. | houseidea"><p><em>Source: houseidea.wordpress.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Development opportunities for apartment complexes:
