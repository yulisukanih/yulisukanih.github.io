Apartments have been a part of humanity for centuries, and some of the earliest examples date back to the ancient Greeks. In Rome, apartments were originally used as quarters for the rich and powerful, and in many cases remain an important part of today’s social lives. In modern times, apartment buildings have become a popular choice for individuals who want to live close to friends and family, but there are a few things that make them unique from other types of dwelling.
The first thing that sets apartments apart from traditional homes is their size. A typical apartment typically occupies several hundred square feet - which is larger than most households in a town or city. This increase in space allows apartments to accommodate more people, making them more convenient and affordable than traditional homes.</p><p>Another unique characteristic of apartments is their location.</p><h2 id=the-olive-tree-apartments---salinas-ca--apartment-finder>The Olive Tree Apartments - Salinas, CA | Apartment Finder<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-olive-tree-apartments---salinas-ca--apartment-finder>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://image4.apartmentfinder.com/i2/enJKFF_OmPNlRb6P5hvhQGfRvz4gFjbijoe21Qe7NJE/117/the-olive-tree-apartments-salinas-ca-building-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.SVIewttK955Y_dCsrbL1NQHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="The Olive Tree Apartments - Salinas, CA | Apartment Finder"><p><em>Source: apartmentfinder.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>What is an apartment?
