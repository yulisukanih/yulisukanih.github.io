These benefits can include:\nReduced rent costs: A landlord can reduce their monthly rent by providing an apartment. This is because an apartment is larger and more expensive than a rental unit that is not an apartment.\nIncreased security: With apartments, tenants have more potential peace of mind knowing that the building has a locksmith and 24-hour security. This increased security can make it difficult for anyone to break into an apartment.\nMore affordable living space: If an apartment is large enough, it may be cheaper to live in one than in multiple rental units. This is because each individual tenant pays only a portion of the monthly rent, which means that landlords are free to charge whatever they want for their units.\n","wordCount":"1099","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-02-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-02-02T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://yulisukanih.github.io/posts/rogers-apartments/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"yulisukanih","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://yulisukanih.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://yulisukanih.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://yulisukanih.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://yulisukanih.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://yulisukanih.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://yulisukanih.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://yulisukanih.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Rogers Apartments : Master Rifle Maker Had Wichita In His Roots</h1><div class=post-description>Mies rohe esplanade racionalista britannica stil architektur eterno referente apartemen internationaler arrancó icónica rascacielos ligero</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-02-02 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 2, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1099 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Me</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#master-rifle-maker-had-wichita-in-his-roots--the-wichita-eagle-the>Master Rifle Maker Had Wichita In His Roots | The Wichita Eagle The</a></li><li><a href=#small-space-hacks-sliding-cabinet-doors-hide-clutter--designs-amp-ideas>Small Space Hacks: Sliding Cabinet Doors Hide Clutter | Designs & Ideas</a></li><li><a href=#yale-building--neighborhoods--open-house-chicago>Yale Building · Neighborhoods · Open House Chicago</a></li><li><a href=#campsite-polari---rovinj-istria---campinghr>Campsite Polari - Rovinj, Istria - CAMPING.HR</a></li><li><a href=#one-hyde-park---london039s-most-exclusive-luxury-apartment--idesignarch>One Hyde Park - London's Most Exclusive Luxury Apartment | IDesignArch</a></li><li><a href=#greenleaf-apartments---chicago-il--apartmentscom>Greenleaf Apartments - Chicago, IL | Apartments.com</a></li><li><a href=#international-style--definition-history-amp-facts--britannica>International Style | Definition, History, & Facts | Britannica</a></li><li><a href=#shoreditch-rooftop-apartment-clere-street-building---e-architect>Shoreditch Rooftop Apartment, Clere Street Building - E-architect</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>Location: How do apartments compare to houses in terms of location?
