One of the most important factors when choosing an apartment is its location. Units that are close to transportation or other amenities are often more affordable than ones located further away from all these things. Another important factor to consider is what type of apartment the tenant will be using. Studios and one-bedrooms tend to be smaller than two- or three-bedroom units, so it may be a better decision not to have those in your search if you plan on living alone.</p><h2 id=terry-hall---uw-hfs>Terry Hall - UW HFS<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#terry-hall---uw-hfs>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://hfs.uw.edu/getmedia/f4bc47bd-1f31-4ef7-b3ad-682b9949ce78/Maple-roof.jpg.aspx?width=1280&height=854&ext=.jpg" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.crhW1CCVZja9KYkZfM0sWgHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="Terry Hall - UW HFS"><p><em>Source: hfs.uw.edu</em></p><blockquote><p>hall terry uw hfs maple undergraduate rates housing.</p></blockquote><p>Types of apartments:
