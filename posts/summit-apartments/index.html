Do you want to live in a high-rise, a condo, or an apartment building? There are three types of apartments: one-, two-, three-, four-.
The five-story apartment buildings are becoming more and more popular. They offer many advantages over other types of apartments: they are easier to find, they&rsquo;re cheaper to buy, and they&rsquo;re usually much nicer than the two-story buildings.</p><p>There&rsquo;s one major drawback to five-story buildings: they can be too expensive. If you want to live in one, it&rsquo;ll cost you at least $200 per month compared to the monthly rent for a two-story building.</p><h2 id=inside-tokyo039s-decaying-1970s-capsule-tower>Inside Tokyo's Decaying 1970s Capsule Tower<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#inside-tokyo039s-decaying-1970s-capsule-tower>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://static.messynessychic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/PonteTowerApartments-577x400.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.ccAld8A-xU_xPNHVHaVCVQHaFI&pid=15.1"' alt="Inside Tokyo's Decaying 1970s Capsule Tower"><p><em>Source: messynessychic.com</em></p><blockquote><p>ponte tower apartment johannesburg inside dark africa complex tallest anywhere apartments capsule south skyscraper decay flickr residential building xcitefun 1970s.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are a great way to live and work.
