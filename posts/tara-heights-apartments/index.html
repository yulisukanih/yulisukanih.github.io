Are pets allowed in apartments?
Many people believe that pets are not allowed in apartments, but this is not always the case. In some cases, pets may be allowed if they are on a leash and under the owner&rsquo;s control. In other cases, pets may not be allowed at all if the apartment is a rental property.</p><h2 id=photo>Photo<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#photo>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2868/13299077414_32ed93dca3_z.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.g5JebSMJAHkycEiZhPbb2gHaF2&pid=15.1"' alt=photo><p><em>Source: flickr.com</em></p><blockquote><p>tara apartments flickr.</p></blockquote><p>Choosing an apartment:
