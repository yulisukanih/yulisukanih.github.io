Apartments that are located in busy areas can be more expensive than those that are located in more rural areas, according to a study by real estate firm RENTCafé.
The study found that the average apartment price in the city of London was £2,898 per month, while the average price for an apartment in the rural area of Berkshire was £1,611 per month.</p><p>The study also found that apartments in the city of Washington D.C. were typically around $2,100 per month while apartments in the rural area of West Virginia were typically around $1,600 per month.</p><p>This suggests that if someone is looking to purchase an apartment they should look for a city with a high population density and low prices for housing.</p><h2 id=ishatvam-9--sanjay-puri-architects---arch2ocom>Ishatvam 9 | Sanjay Puri Architects - Arch2O.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ishatvam-9--sanjay-puri-architects---arch2ocom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.arch2o.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Arch2O-ishatvam-9-sanjay-puri-architects-16.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.iA1-99fgURoDR1GbWM4bLgHaLM&pid=15.1"' alt="Ishatvam 9 | Sanjay Puri Architects - Arch2O.com"><p><em>Source: arch2o.com</em></p><blockquote><p>sanjay puri ishatvam arch2o ranchi dinesh mehta homify.</p></blockquote><p>Cost of living in apartments:
